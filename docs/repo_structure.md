# Repository structure

Everything about the repository file structure.

## Docs

This folder holds all the game's documentation and design documents

## Src

This is where the main game logic and assets are located.

Files should be kept using the following structure:

levels: where the main levels are located.

scenes: Miscelanious scenes, such as the player.

Everything inside those folders should have a scene and everything relating to that scene should be kept a subfolder of the same name.
